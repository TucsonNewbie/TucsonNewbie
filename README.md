- 👋 Hi, I’m @TucsonNewbie. I'm a retired radio announcer and old school DIY hobbyist tinkerer. I'm going to guess that 99% of the people here on GitHub know 
far more computers and coding than I do. Hence, my "newbie" moniker and, yes, I happen to live in Tucson, Arizona, USA. My expertise is wood and metalworking 
(I learned guitar luthiery and built/repaired stringed musical instuments for a living in my early adult years) and I have a lifelong fascination with industrial 
designand, for lack of a better decription, how things work. I've also employed myself over the years as an audio engineer in the capacity of providing concert 
sound reinforcement and location of acoustic lmusic with ive-to-2-track audio recording techniques. 

- 👀 I’m interested in renewable energy and climate change solutions, especially the intersection of electric vehicles (I've been driving one since 2015,) 
solar PV and battery technology. I really do think that these relatively new inventions are going to be what save humanity from a heating planet that and we have 
to adopt them en masse as soon as possible. For that to happen, these devices and ones like them are going to have to get beyond the early adopter phase and
into the hands of individuals of all economic and social classes. 

- 🌱 I’m currently learning as much as I can at the about Linux operating systems. Around a decade and a half ago, I had a One Laptop Per Child (OPLC) XO-1 
computer and briefly learned bits and pieces of coding procedures for making it function. I have ordered (hopefully it will be shipping soon) a Rasberry 
Pi / Linux tablet called a Cutie Pi. I'm intrigued by the design of these devices and, increaingly, the open source protocol of both their software and hardware. 
I'm an advocate of the Right To Repair movement and plan to, as much as possible, surround myself with technology that adheares to these practices. 

- 💞️ I really don't a project that is in search of a collaborator at the moment. I'm basically here to learn and, perhaps, find myself getting invoved in 
something that I can positively contribute to. As to what that is, exactly, remains to be seen. 

- 📫 How to reach me? First, my actual name is Benjamin Nead. Email is the easiest way to communicate with me from afar: tucsonplugsin@gmail.com
